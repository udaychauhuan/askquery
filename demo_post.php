            A welcome blog post introduces your blog to the world. It shouldn’t consist only of a brief announcement, though, because you’re setting the stage for future content. You must let people know that you’re an authority in your industry and that you’re capable of producing meaty, engaging content.<br><br>

            Think of your welcome or introductory blog post as your audition. You only get one chance to get it right, and your audience will decide based on its content whether they want to return to your blog. Don’t let your anxiety take over, though, because we’re going to share a formula that works.
